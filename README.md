# Auto-Loan-Default-Prediction-System-
Auto loan defaults have become a critical issue for financial institutions, particularly NonBanking Financial Institutions (NBFIs), as they heavily rely on vehicle loans. This study focuses 
on identifying the factors that contribute to auto loan defaults, such as loan term length, 
economic downturns, interest rate fluctuations, and consumer financial literacy. Rising defaults, 
fueled by high auto prices, soaring interest rates, and negative equity, strain NBFIsâ€™ profitability 
and increase their risk exposure. The analysis emphasizes the need for predictive modeling to 
assess borrowers' repayment capabilities, enabling NBFIs to mitigate risks and improve decisionmaking. Implementing solutions like digital transformation, alternative lease loans, and financial 
education programs can further reduce defaults and enhance lending strategies for NBFIs.
